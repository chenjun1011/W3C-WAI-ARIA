# <a id="normative"></a>3. Normative Requirements for WAI-ARIA

This section is [normative](#def_normative).

This specification indicates whether a section is [normative](#def_normative) or [informative](#def_informative). Classifying a section as normative or informative applies to the entire section. A statement "This section is normative" or "This section is informative" applies to all sub-sections of that section.

Normative sections provide requirements that authors, user agents, and assistive technologies **MUST** follow for an implementation to conform to this specification. The keywords **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** in this document are to be interpreted as described in [Keywords for use in RFCs to indicate requirement levels](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) \[[RFC2119](#ref_RFC2119)\]. RFC-2119 keywords are formatted in uppercase and contained in a `strong` element with `class="rfc2119"`. When the keywords shown above are used, but do not share this format, they do not convey formal information in the RFC 2119 sense, and are merely explanatory, i.e., informative. As much as possible, such usages are avoided in this specification.

Informative sections provide information useful to understanding the specification. Such sections may contain examples of recommended practice, but it is not required to follow such recommendations in order to conform to this specification.
